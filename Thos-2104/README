This is the "Two Hour Operating System", material that I've been
presenting in a 2-hour lesson a few times since September 2010.

Initially I've been using an ARM7 system (LPC2104, mounted in the
"christmas tree" board by Embedded Artists).  The tree is not sold any
more, so this version is based on a Cortex-M3 (LPC1343, mounted in a
simple board by Olimex.  I may add the ARM7 implementation or other
ones as subdirectories, over time.

All documentation is in doc/ (you need TeX and Texinfo to compile it,
but if you download the tarball, output files are already there.

I may re-release this thing with a little updates (or ports to other
embedded CPU cores) over time, but not more than once per month.

Enjoy
